1. Why did we add a Collection to this contract? List the two main reasons.
Collection was used to reduce the number of storage paths for multiple items and to enable others to put things in the Collection.  

2. What do you have to do if you have resources "nested" inside of another resource? ("Nested resources")
You must have a destroy function that destroys the nested resources.

3. Brainstorm some extra things we may want to add to this contract. Think about what might be problematic with this contract and how we could fix it.

Idea #1: Do we really want everyone to be able to mint an NFT? ðŸ¤”.
Change access of createNFT() to access(account).

Idea #2: If we want to read information about our NFTs inside our Collection, right now we have to take it out of the Collection to do so. Is this good?
We could add a function to return a reference to an NFT in the collection or iterates over references to the NFTs.
