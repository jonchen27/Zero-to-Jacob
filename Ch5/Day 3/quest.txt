1. What does "force casting" with as! do? Why is it useful in our Collection?
Force casting allows us to downcast a variable to a more specific type. This is useful to ensure that we are only putting our specific type of NFT in the Collection.

2. What does auth do? When do we use it?
Auth marks a variable as eligble for downcasting. This enables us to downcast the generic type to our specific type in order to access our unique fields.
